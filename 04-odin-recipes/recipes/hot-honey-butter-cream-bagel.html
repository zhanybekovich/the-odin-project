    <p>
      This hot honey butter cream cheese stuffed bagel is a twist on the viral
      air fryer stuffed bagel, with tangy cream cheese inside and a hot
      honey-caramelized outside.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 bagel</li>
      <li>1 ounce cream cheese, cut into 8 slices</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon hot honey or regular honey, plus more for drizzle</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (199 degrees C) according to
        manufacturer's instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make 8 small cuts in the bagel, taking care not to cut all the way
        through, to create small openings. Add a piece of cream cheese in each
        crevice around the bagel. Combine honey and melted butter in a small
        dish and coat the stuffed bagel liberally. Sprinkle with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place bagel in the air fryer until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Drizzle
        with more honey if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
